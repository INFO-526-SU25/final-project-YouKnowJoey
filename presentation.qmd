# Introduction - "Pawsome" Animal Shelter Data

We want ALL animals adopted!

## About Animal Shelter Data

- Source: Long Beach, CA Animal Care Services Open Data Portal

- Dataset: TidyTuesday (Week of 2025-03-04)

- Records: 29,787 animal intakes and outcomes (2021–2025)

- Key Fields: Intake/Outcome Dates, Intake Condition, Animal Type, Outcome Type, Date of Birth, Geolocation

## Our Questions

Understanding the factors that influence animal shelter outcomes is essential for improving animal welfare and operational efficiency. By exploring these questions, we aim to identify gaps, disparities, and opportunities for intervention. Provide actionable insights to guide shelter policies, resource allocation, and effectiveness of shelter practices over time.

1. How do intake conditions and animal types affect the animal's outcome?

2. How Have Adoption Volumes and Timelines Evolved (2017–2024) Across Dogs, Cats, and Other Species?

## Data Considerations (Part 1)
What must we change in the Data?

  - **Simplified `species_group`:** 
  
  `animal_type` is grouped as `"Dog"`, `"Cat"`, `"Other"`
  
  - **Create `age_at_intake`:**
  
  (`intake_date` - `dob`) / 365
  
  - **Create `days_to_adoption`:**
  
  (`outcome_date` - `intake_date`)

## Data Considerations (Part 2)

**Justification for `species_group`**

## Data Considerations (Part 3)

Animal Outcome Category Classification

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

- `adopted`

- `death`

- `non-death`

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r}
# Classify 3 outcome categories
outcome_summary <- tibble(
  outcome_category = c("adopted", "death", "non-death"),
  subcategories = list(
    c("adoption", "foster to adopt", "homefirst"),
    c("euthanasia", "died", "disposal"),
    c("rescue", "transfer", "return to owner", 
      "shelter, neuter, return", "return to rescue", 
      "transport", "community cat", "return to wild habitat", 
      "foster", "trap, neuter, release", 
      "missing", "NA", "duplicate", "others")
  )
)

outcome_summary |> 
  unnest(cols = subcategories)

#  Conclusions

## Our Insights

- "Other" species face lower adoption rates and higher death rates

- Favorable intake conditions lead to higher chances of adoption; animals arriving in poor condition face significantly worse outcomes. 

- Dog and cat adoptions surged after 2020 pandemic dip; "Other" species showed gains but more variability

- Dogs are rehomed quickest, cats show more long-stay variability

- There's faster median time to adoption, despite rising volumes

## Takeaways

- Highlights need for targeted care and intervention for "Other" species that are underrepresented and more vulnerable. 

- Fast median times reflects shelter staff and volunteer efforts to improve animal outcomes

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
