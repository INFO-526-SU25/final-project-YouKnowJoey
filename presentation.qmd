## About Animal Shelter Data

-   Source: Long Beach, CA Animal Care Services Open Data Portal

-   Dataset: TidyTuesday (Week of 2025-03-04)

-   Records: 29,787 animal intakes and outcomes (2017-2024)

-   Key Fields: Intake/Outcome Dates, Intake Condition, Animal Type, Outcome Type, Date of Birth, Geolocation

## Our Questions

Understanding the factors that influence animal shelter outcomes is essential for improving animal welfare and operational efficiency. By exploring these questions, we aim to identify gaps, disparities, and opportunities for intervention. Provide actionable insights to guide shelter policies, resource allocation, and effectiveness of shelter practices over time.

1.  How do intake conditions and animal types affect the animal's outcome?

2.  How Have Adoption Volumes and Timelines Evolved (2017–2024) Across Dogs, Cats, and Other Species?

# Conclusions & Takeaways

-   Highlights need for targeted care and intervention for "Other" species that are underrepresented and more vulnerable

-   Fast median times reflects shelter staff and volunteer efforts to improve animal outcomes
