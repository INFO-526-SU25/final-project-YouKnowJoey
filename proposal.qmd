description: "This project will graphically depict trends, patterns, and analysis of Animal Shelter data derived from the TidyTuesday initiative. The dataset includes information about animals taken in and released from the shelter; there are variables such as intake type, outcome type, animal type, breed, age, and more. The primary goal of this project is to identify key factors that influence an animals outcome."

This TidyTuesday dataset is a conglomeration of different species retrieved in Long Beach, CA. It contains 22 columns and 29,787 rows that provides potential insights of rescued animals at the city's shelter. The data includes variables such as intake type, outcome type, animal type, age, breed, and geographical jurisdiction. We chose this dataset because it offers an opportunity to explore animal shelters and outcomes. Meaningful and relevant analysis could have direct implications for animal welfare policies and shelter resource management.

### Questions

1.  How do intake conditions, animal types, and ages affect the animal's outcome?

2.  Over the years 2021–2025, how have different species and intake conditions influenced the duration from intake to adoption?

## Analysis plan

For each question, we plan the following:

### 1. How do intake conditions, animal types, and ages affect the animal's outcome?

We will model $y_1$ as a function of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ using a linear model (subject to change).

Variables:

-   $x_1$ = age_at_intake (calculated by dob and intake_date)

-   $x_2$ = intake_condition

-   $x_3$ = animal_type

-   $y_1$ = outcome type

### 2. Over the years 2021–2025, how have different species and intake conditions influenced the duration from intake to adoption?

We'll mutate() a new variable $y_2$ as the time difference between intake and outcome dates, then analyze its variation by $x_4$ and $x_5$ across years.

Variables:

-   $x_4$ = animal_type

-   $x_5$ = intake_conditions

-   $x_6$ = intake_year (derived from intake_date)

-   $x_7$ = outcome_type

-   $y_2$ = days_to_adoption (computed by outcome_date - intake_date)
