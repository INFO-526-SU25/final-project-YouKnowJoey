## Dataset

```{r}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false
```

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions (Working Ideas)

1. At time of intake, how are intake condition, animal type, and age associated with the likelihood and time to adoption?

2. Over years 2021â€“2025, how have intake and outcome types varied for different species of animals?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
